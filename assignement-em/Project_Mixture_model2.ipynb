    "# Clustering of image data with Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the last project that mixture models / k-means are a powerful way to detect groups in multidimensional real data. However, mixture models can be easily generalized to other types of data.\n",
    "The goal of the project is to implement a mixture model that can cluster image data using a mixture of bernoulli distributions. \n",
    "This jupyter notebook will serve as a guide for the different steps of the implementation of the model and of its estimation. In the last part we will try to apply our model to recover missing part of an image! This is also called imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find expected outputs throughout the notebook that should match your output for the same example input, given the correct implementation of the function bodys.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note:` Throughout the notebook you will find docstrings describing the in and output of the different functions, these are meant as hints to guide during the implementation. Whether you meet the exact type or not is up to you and will not be graded as long as your implementation returns the expected result. If your implementation is slow it might be sufficient to use half of the dataset for good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For grading, you are just expected to fill in this notebook. Feel free to add text answers within the notebook whenever appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Have fun!"

    "You can see in the plot that the value matrices of the different $x$ contain values $\\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$, representing pixel intensity on the grey scale. However, we want to reduce dimensionality for this project and transform all values to be in ${0,1}$ while keeping a meaningful representation of the original image. This will help us later when we want to think more in terms of probabilities, e.g., the probability for a pixel being on (white) given its image class. We can then model each pixel as an independant Bernoulli for our approximation. In addition, we will later work on (flattened matrices) vectors $\\vec{v} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{d*d}$ instead of matrices $x \\in \\mathbb{N}^{d\\times d}$.\n",

    "Let's get back to the `MNIST` dataset. This dataset was prepared for a supervised learning task. For each $x \\in X_{\\text{train}}$ we have a label $y \\in Y_{\\text{train}}$. We can partition $X_{\\text{train}}$ into $|C|$ subsets that correspond to the images for each of the digits ($X^{(1)}$ are all the samples for digit $1$, $X^{(2)}$ for digit $2$, and so on).\n",

    "Apply the binary matrix transformations from earlier sections to the training dataset and implement the function body for `compute_class_representative()` that computes a representative value vector (flattened matrix) for a set of input matrices. Then use this function to compute representatives for $c = \\{1,3,8\\}$.\n",
    "In this case you can think of the representative value matrix (or vector) as a matrix (or vector) in which each value resembles the probability of the corresponding pixel being white (= a value of 1). This probability is computed given all matrices (or vectors) of that class. You will compute a maximum a posteriori estimate. You may use pseudo-counts if neccessary.\n",
